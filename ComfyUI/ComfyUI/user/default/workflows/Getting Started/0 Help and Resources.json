        "# 📘 ComfyUI Definitions (Easy Guide)\n\n▶ This note explains common ComfyUI terms in simple language for new users.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Model (General)\n\n▶ A **model** is what ComfyUI uses to generate images or video.  \n▶ It has learned patterns from training data and uses your prompt to create results.\n\n📌 In ComfyUI, “model” can mean different things depending on how it is loaded.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Checkpoint (All-in-One Model)\n\n▶ A **checkpoint** is a model file that usually contains:\n- the diffusion model\n- text encoder(s)\n- and sometimes a VAE\n\n▶ Checkpoints are easy to use because everything is bundled together.  \n▶ They are loaded with **Load Checkpoint** nodes.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Diffusion Model (Component)\n\n▶ A **diffusion model** is the part that actually creates the image.  \n▶ It works by slowly turning noise into a picture.\n\n▶ Some workflows use diffusion models **by themselves**, instead of full checkpoints.  \n▶ In that case, text encoders and VAEs are loaded separately.\n\n---\n\n## 🧾 Text Encoder\n\n▶ A **text encoder** converts your text prompt into data the model understands.  \n▶ It turns words into numbers that guide the image generation.\n\n▶ Newer ComfyUI versions use **text_encoders**.  \n▶ Older versions may call this **CLIP**.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 VAE (Variational Autoencoder)\n\n▶ A **VAE** converts the model’s internal data into a visible image.  \n▶ It affects colors, contrast, and overall image look.\n\n▶ Some checkpoints include a VAE.  \n▶ Other workflows load a VAE separately to change the final result.\n\n---\n\n## 🎨 LoRA (Low-Rank Adapter)\n\n▶ A **LoRA** is a small add-on model.  \n▶ It modifies the style, subject, or behavior of a main model.\n\n▶ LoRAs do **not** work by themselves.  \n▶ They must be used together with a checkpoint or diffusion model.\n\n---\n\n## 🖼 txt2img (Text to Image)\n\n▶ **txt2img** means creating an image using only a text prompt.  \n▶ The model starts from noise and generates an image step by step.\n\n▶ This is the most common way to begin using ComfyUI.\n\n---\n\n## 🖼 img2img (Image to Image)\n\n▶ **img2img** means using an existing image as input.  \n▶ The model changes or improves the image based on your prompt.\n\n▶ Useful for edits, style changes, and refining images.\n\n---\n\n## 🎞 txt2video (Text to Video)\n\n▶ **txt2video** creates video frames from a text prompt.  \n▶ It works like txt2img, but generates many images over time.\n\n▶ This usually requires more VRAM and special workflows.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Latent\n\n▶ A **latent** is the hidden data the model works with internally.  \n▶ Images are generated in latent form before being decoded by a VAE.\n\n▶ You normally do not see latents unless a workflow exposes them.\n\n---\n\n## 🔁 Sampler\n\n▶ A **sampler** controls how the image is generated step by step.  \n▶ Different samplers affect sharpness, noise, and style.\n\n▶ Samplers are selected in nodes like **KSampler**.\n\n---\n\n## 🔢 Steps\n\n▶ **Steps** control how many refinement passes the model makes.  \n▶ More steps can increase detail but take longer.\n\n▶ Too many steps can reduce image quality.\n\n---\n\n## ⚖ CFG (Guidance Scale)\n\n▶ **CFG** controls how strongly the model follows your prompt.  \n▶ Lower values = more creative freedom  \n▶ Higher values = more literal results\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Workflow\n\n▶ A **workflow** is the node graph in ComfyUI.  \n▶ It defines how models, prompts, and settings connect together.\n\n▶ Workflows can be saved, shared, and reused.\n\n---\n\n## 📌 Final Tip\n\n▶ If these terms feel confusing at first, that’s normal.  \n▶ ComfyUI is powerful, and understanding comes step by step.\n\n"

        "# 🔄 Updating ComfyUI (Easy Install)\n\n▶ This note explains how to update ComfyUI when using the **Easy Install** setup, and what each `.bat` file does.\n\n---\n\n## 📂 Easy Install Folder Overview\n\n▶ In the Easy Install folder you will usually see:\n- the **ComfyUI** folder\n- the **python_embedded** folder\n- several `.bat` files\n\n📌 These `.bat` files are helper scripts to make updating easier.\n\n---\n\n## ▶ Start ComfyUI.bat\n\n▶ **Start ComfyUI.bat** is used to **launch ComfyUI**.\n\n✔ Starts ComfyUI using the embedded Python  \n✔ Uses the correct environment automatically  \n✔ Safe to use anytime\n\n📌 This file does **NOT** update anything.\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 Update ComfyUI.bat\n\n▶ **Update ComfyUI.bat** updates **only the core ComfyUI files**.\n\n✔ Updates ComfyUI itself  \n✔ Does NOT update custom nodes  \n✔ Does NOT update Easy Install\n\n📌 Use this when:\n- ComfyUI has a bug fix\n- You want core improvements\n- Custom nodes are already working fine\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 Update ComfyUI and Nodes.bat\n\n▶ **Update ComfyUI and Nodes.bat** updates:\n- core ComfyUI\n- installed custom nodes\n\n✔ Most complete update option  \n✔ Useful when workflows require newer nodes\n\n⚠ This can sometimes cause:\n- custom nodes to break\n- workflows to stop working\n\n📌 Use this when:\n- a workflow requires updated nodes\n- you understand updates may cause issues\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 Update Easy-Install.bat\n\n▶ **Update Easy-Install.bat** updates the **Easy Install helper system itself**.\n\n✔ Updates installer scripts  \n✔ Updates helper logic  \n✔ Does NOT directly update ComfyUI models\n\n📌 Use this when:\n- Easy Install adds new features\n- installer behavior changes\n- you are told to update Easy Install\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Safe Update Order (Recommended)\n\n▶ To reduce problems, update in this order:\n\n1. Close ComfyUI  \n2. Run **Update ComfyUI.bat**  \n3. Test ComfyUI  \n4. Only then run **Update ComfyUI and Nodes.bat** if needed  \n5. Restart ComfyUI\n\n📌 Avoid updating everything at once unless required.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠ Important Update Tips\n\n✔ Always close ComfyUI before updating  \n✔ Restart ComfyUI after updates  \n✔ Press **R** to refresh models (not nodes)  \n✔ Keep working workflows backed up  \n✔ Updates can introduce new bugs\n\n---\n\n## 🐞 If Something Breaks After Updating\n\n▶ If ComfyUI itself breaks:\n- check the official ComfyUI GitHub issues\n\n▶ If a specific custom node breaks:\n- check that node’s GitHub issues page\n\n📌 Many update issues are temporary and get fixed quickly.\n\n---\n\n## 📌 Final Advice\n\n▶ If everything works, you do **not** need to update immediately.  \n▶ Update when:\n- you need a fix\n- you need a feature\n- a workflow requires it\n\n▶ Stability is more important than being on the latest version.\n"
