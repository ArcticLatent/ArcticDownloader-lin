## 📚 Overview

Arctic ComfyUI Helper mirrors the exact builds shown in Arctic Latent tutorials, so you can follow along with less setup friction.

Think of it as:
- A built-in **ComfyUI installer** for Windows (easy setup from inside the app)
- A curated model/LoRA catalog matched to your hardware tiers
- A one-click downloader that places assets into the correct ComfyUI folders

---

## 🧩 Core Features

- 🛠️ **ComfyUI install module** (uv-managed Python + selectable add-ons/custom nodes)
- 🧠 **Tier-aware catalog** that filters by your GPU VRAM and system RAM
- 📦 **Auto-dependency downloads** (text encoders, CLIPs, upscalers, and other required files)
- 🗂️ **Smart file placement** into the correct ComfyUI subfolders
- 📈 **Live download progress** with active/completed transfer tracking
- 🔐 **Optional Civitai token support** for authenticated LoRA downloads
- 🖼️ **LoRA preview + metadata** in-app (description, triggers, creator link)
- ♻️ **Auto-update support** through GitHub Releases manifest
- 🧵 **System tray controls** to Start/Stop ComfyUI even when the main window is hidden

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Download the latest `Arctic-ComfyUI-Helper.exe` from this repo's **Releases** page.
2. Run the app.
3. In **Models** / **LoRAs**, select your existing ComfyUI folder to download assets.
4. In **ComfyUI** tab, use **Install New** (or **Manage Existing**) if you want the app to install/manage ComfyUI itself.

That is it. Pick your setup, click, and the app handles the rest.

---

## 🔄 Auto-Updates

On startup, the app checks:

`https://github.com/ArcticLatent/Arctic-Helper/releases/latest/download/update.json`

If a newer version is found, the app downloads, verifies checksum, replaces binary, and restarts.

---

## ✅ Requirements

- Latest NVIDIA drivers installed
- Internet connection (for catalog, model files, and optional installer tasks)
- For some Civitai LoRAs: a valid Civitai API token

---

## 💡 Usage Tips

- If a LoRA says unauthorized, add your Civitai token in-app and save it.
- If you run multiple ComfyUI installs, use the ComfyUI tab's install/manage mode and detected installs list.
